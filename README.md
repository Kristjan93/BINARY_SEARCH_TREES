#BINARY SEARCH TREES
**Info on the assignment:**

   
   By showing off your newly acquired knowledge of data structures, you have become immensely popular. In fact, you have become so popular that your contact manager program can no longer handle so many contacts, and has become unbearably slow. You figure something must be done and decide to write your own contact manager.
   In this assignment, you are going to create the abstract data type ContactManager using binary search trees to enable fast search queries. Binary search trees and their variations are used in numerous computing applications, including spelling correction, package routing, memory allocation and genomic pattern detection. Your binary search tree will be encapsulated as a map.
   A map is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. Put another way, it is a collection of unordered values accessed by key rather than by index.
   An interactive main-program that uses your contact manager is supplied for fun and glory.
